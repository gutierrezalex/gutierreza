Re-design of their [past website](https://web.archive.org/web/20120505083124/http://e4inc.com/). Created mockups to discuss the look and feel. I then proceeded to markup and style(HTML & CSS) on Wordpress. Lastly, I visited their midtown office, and instructed the team on how to update the website.
