Re-design of their [past website](https://web.archive.org/web/20120505083124/http://e4inc.com/). Created mockups that started the conversation on the look and feel. Once okayed, I proceded to markup and style—running on Wordpress. Lastly, I visit their midtown office, and instructed the team on how to update the website.
